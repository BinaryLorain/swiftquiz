# SwiftQuiz

## What is it?

swiftQuiz is designed to be used in face-to-face lessons.
The teacher may plan questions in advance, but can also easily improvise on the fly.
Write your question on the blackboard, and select an appropriate question type from the dropdown menu.
Several improvised questions will already be included: Short answer, multi-choice (3, 4 & 5), true/false.

And you can use the **create** button to swiftly create a question, while providing different problem types.

During the lesson, the teacher starts the quiz. Students can now connect to this quiz.
Once the teacher is satisfied that all students have connected to the quiz, they can click on **Start Quiz**
Depending on the question settings the question will end automatically, or will need to be ended via the instructor's
**End question** button. The teacher can start a vote, with the selected responses, which students can answer.

The teacher can, at a later date, go back through the results and, for each question, see exactly what answer each student gave.
The repolls are treated as separate questions, and you will get a correct order in the review page.

The Mod Swift Quiz is based on Jazz Quiz,  however it contains the extra features

- More flexibility to create real-time questions, allowing you to edit both the content of the question and the answer.
- Multiple choice answers display optimization, correct answers and wrong answers are distinguished by green and red, and the percentage of people who choose different answers can be displayed.
- The display of answers for multiple-choice questions and drag-and-drop questions is specially optimized, so that multiple-choice questions can display the number of exactly correct answers, and drag-and-drop questions can display the number of selected answers for every empty answer.
- A word cloud display feature has been added for short Answer type questions, so you can decide whether to use this feature or not.

## Please note

The original plugin, Realtime Quiz, was written by Davo Smith: <moodle@davosmith.co.uk>

Afterwards came ActiveQuiz, funded by an educational innovation grant given to the Medical school, the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

Then Hans Georg Schaathun (<hasc@ntnu.no>) et al. developed JazzQuiz based on ActiveQuiz.

SwiftQuiz is a fork of JazzQuiz, intended for different use cases.

SwiftQuiz is part of **XJTLU** TDF20/21 - R22-145.
